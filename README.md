# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Consistenly

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes don't seem to apply as expected. The hover effect is not working, and the base background color may be missing. 

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to resolve the issue.

**Possible causes:**
* **Typographical errors in class names:** Double-check the spelling and casing of your Tailwind CSS class names.
* **Incorrect order of CSS rules:** Ensure that your Tailwind CSS styles are applied correctly, especially if using `!important` flags. 
* **Conflicting styles:** Check for conflicts with other CSS rules that might override Tailwind styles.
* **Issues with Tailwind's configuration:** Verify that the Tailwind CSS plugin is correctly set up and configured for your project.
* **Missing or incorrect PurgeCSS configuration (if used):** Ensure that your `purge` options in your `tailwind.config.js` accurately reflects all the classes used in your project. 
* **Incorrect import of Tailwind CSS:** Confirm that you have properly imported Tailwind CSS in your CSS file.
* **Cache issues:** Try clearing your browser's cache and restarting your development server.
